MCMC

- ## Rejection Sampling

In numerical analysis and computational statistics, rejection sampling is a basic technique used to generate observations from a distribution. Rejection sampling is based on the observation that to sample a random variable in one dimension, one can perform a uniformly random sampling of the two-dimensional Cartesian graph, and keep the samples in the region under the graph of its density function. Note that this property can be extended to N-dimension functions
